# RegentClaw Maturity Matrix (2026)

**Date:** 2026-05-30  
**Purpose:** Public, conservative status tracking for platform security/runtime maturity.

Status legend:
- **Shipped**: in mainline runtime with verifiable behavior.
- **In Progress**: partially implemented or feature-flagged; not complete.
- **Planned**: scoped, not yet implemented.

| Capability Area | Status | Current Evidence | Gaps to Close |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cryptographic agent identity mesh | In Progress | Ed25519 inter-agent signing + verify endpoint | Full attestation mesh (SPIFFE-like), key lifecycle/rotation policy |
| Hard execution isolation model | In Progress | Ring policy + Trust Fabric ring decisions + route-level convergence in exec/remediation | Full OS sandbox guarantees across all execution channels |
| Formal SRE governance layer | In Progress | Error-budget + circuit-breaker primitives, SRE API/status endpoints | Published SLO docs, error-budget policy packs, richer telemetry/export |
| OWASP Agentic Top 10 evidence mapping | In Progress | Dedicated ASI mapping markdown + linked controls | Per-category adversarial tests and deeper evidence anchors |
| Inter-agent secure messaging (prod default) | In Progress | Feature-flagged signed secure channel in swarm task paths + verify endpoint | Default-on rollout + key governance + replay resistance policy |
| Policy test harness strength | In Progress | Ring tests + trust-fabric regressions + policy-pack allow/deny + replay regressions | Chaos/replay expansion and CI policy gates tied to policy diffs |
| Multi-tenant hardening proof | In Progress | Tenant isolation suite + scaffold tests + boundary documentation | Enforced owner/tenant scoping across all list/get paths and secrets retrieval |
| Connector trust/provenance verification | In Progress | Gateway scan/policy checks on installs | Signed provenance and checksum verification chain |
| Operator-grade executive reporting | In Progress | Trust Fabric dashboard + probes + status panels + Swarm live event stream | Executive risk rollups linked to evidence/compliance controls |
| Swarm runtime maturity | In Progress | Bounded parallel execution + real `/task` routing for Identity/Cloud/Threat/Arc + SSE stream | Expand real `/task` coverage to remaining claws and connector-backed execution |
| Model routing maturity (ModelClaw) | In Progress | ModelClaw scaffold with governed route/profile/provider/call-audit endpoints | Persistent storage + provider adapters + per-tenant profile governance |
| Public maturity transparency | In Progress | This matrix + OWASP split docs | Keep matrix synced with code and tests each release |
