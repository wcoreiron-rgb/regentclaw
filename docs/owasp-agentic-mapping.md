## LLM01 – Prompt Injection

**Description:** Prompt injection attacks manipulate LLM inputs to override instructions, exfiltrate data, or cause unintended behavior. In agentic systems this is especially dangerous because agents have tool access and can take real-world actions based on injected instructions.

**RegentClaw Status:** Shipped

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/routes.py` (lines 63–91): Every AI event submission runs a dual-layer inspection:
  1. AGT `PromptDefenseEvaluator` — 12-vector injection audit covering direct injection, indirect injection, jailbreak attempts, role confusion, instruction override, and more.
  2. `scan_text()` from `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/scanner.py` — complementary pattern-based detection for sensitive data patterns that could indicate exfiltration.
- `backend/app/trust_fabric/agt_bridge.py`: `audit_prompt()` function called on every `POST /api/v1/arcclaw/events` and `POST /api/v1/arcclaw/chat`.
- Events with injection findings are blocked or flagged before tool execution proceeds.
- Results are written to the audit log with risk scores and vector detail.

**Test Coverage:** No automated test for prompt injection paths. Manual testing via `POST /api/v1/arcclaw/events` with known injection payloads.

**Known Limitations:**
- The AGT PromptDefenseEvaluator covers 12 vectors but may not catch all novel jailbreak techniques.
- Indirect injection (data poisoning from external sources read by an agent) is detected via pattern matching only — semantic detection would require additional LLM-as-judge tooling.
- No red-team test suite is included in the repository.

---

## LLM02 – Insecure Output Handling

**Description:** Failures to validate or sanitize LLM outputs before they are passed to downstream systems, rendered in browsers, or executed as code. Can lead to XSS, SQL injection, SSRF, or arbitrary command execution.

**RegentClaw Status:** Partially Shipped

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/scanner.py`: `scan_text()` redacts secrets, API keys, and PII patterns from content. Applied to prompts and available for output scanning.
- DLP scanner (`backend/app/services/finding_pipeline.py`) flags sensitive patterns in event payloads.
- API responses do not reflect raw LLM output directly to clients — outputs pass through structured Pydantic schemas before serialization.
- Output scanning is applied to submitted prompts but **not systematically applied to LLM response text** before it is stored or returned.

**Test Coverage:** No automated test. The scanner functions are exercised via integration but not in an isolated unit test.

**Known Limitations:**
- LLM response bodies are stored and returned without a second-pass output scan. If a model returns malicious content (e.g., XSS payload, injected command), it is not re-inspected before storage.
- No HTML sanitization layer exists for outputs rendered in the frontend.
- Output sanitization should be applied symmetrically to both prompts and completions.

---

## LLM03 – Training Data Poisoning

**Description:** Manipulation of training data to introduce backdoors, biases, or vulnerabilities into a model's behavior.

**RegentClaw Status:** N/A

**Evidence:**

- RegentClaw does not train, fine-tune, or host model weights. All LLM capability is consumed via external provider APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama).
- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/llm_proxy.py`: `call_llm()` delegates to configured providers via API calls. No training pipeline exists.
- Model selection is configured via `backend/app/core/config.py` settings — no weight files are bundled.

**Test Coverage:** N/A

**Known Limitations:**
- Supply-chain risk from model providers remains (covered under LLM05). If a hosted model is poisoned by a provider, RegentClaw has no detection mechanism.
- No model output consistency checks or behavior baseline comparisons are implemented.

---

## LLM04 – Model Denial of Service

**Description:** Attacks that consume excessive compute, memory, or API quota by submitting crafted inputs (very long prompts, recursive queries, resource-intensive completions).

**RegentClaw Status:** In Progress

**Evidence:**

- `backend/main.py`: `slowapi` rate limiter applied to authentication endpoints.
- `POST /api/v1/arcclaw/events` and `/arcclaw/chat` do not currently have per-user rate limiting beyond the global auth limiter.
- Prompt length is not capped before being sent to the model provider.
- No token budget or cost-cap enforcement is implemented at the API layer.

**Test Coverage:** No automated test.

**Known Limitations:**
- LLM-specific DoS protection (prompt length limits, per-user quota, token counting, backpressure) is not yet implemented on AI endpoints.
- A sufficiently long or pathological prompt could exhaust provider API quota.
- No circuit-breaker or fallback behavior when provider returns 429/503.
- Planned: per-endpoint rate limiting via slowapi on ArcClaw routes.

## LLM05 – Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced through third-party model providers, plugins, datasets, fine-tuning services, or compromised Python packages in the dependency graph.

**RegentClaw Status:** In Progress

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/services/secrets_manager.py`: Connector credentials encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC). Keys never stored in plaintext.
- `requirements.txt`: PyJWT pinned to 2.9.0 (patched version). `python-multipart` pinned to 0.0.12 (patched for CVE-2024-53498).
- Connector field validation in `backend/app/api/routes/connectors.py` prevents SSRF via URL validation.
- No automated dependency vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Snyk, pip-audit) is integrated into CI.
- No Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated.

**Test Coverage:** No automated test.

**Known Limitations:**
- No automated supply-chain scanning — transitive dependency vulnerabilities would not be caught automatically.
- No SBOM generation in the build pipeline.
- Model provider API keys are encrypted at rest but transmitted via HTTPS to third-party endpoints — provider compromise is out of scope for RegentClaw's threat model.
- Plugin/connector installs require approval via policy (ZT — Block Connector Install Without Approval) but connector code is not sandboxed at the OS level.

---

## LLM06 – Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Description:** LLMs inadvertently revealing sensitive data — PII, credentials, financial data, or system internals — through model memorization, prompt echoing, or insufficient output filtering.

**RegentClaw Status:** Shipped

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/services/secrets_manager.py`: All connector credentials stored Fernet-encrypted at rest. The encryption key is auto-generated per deployment in `backend/.secrets/` (gitignored).
- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/scanner.py`: `scan_text()` pattern-matches for API keys, tokens, AWS credentials, credit card numbers, SSNs, and email addresses. Applied to every submitted prompt.
- `backend/app/api/routes/exec_channels.py`: Credential injection endpoint never returns secret values via API — secrets are injected into agent runtime only (`"note": "Secret value is never returned via API"`).
- Credential broker returns `secret_path` and `secret_type` but not the secret value itself.
- Audit log records actor, action, and outcome but redacts sensitive parameter values.
- `backend/app/api/routes/connectors.py`: Credential hints are masked in responses (last 4 characters only).

**Test Coverage:** No automated test for DLP paths. Scanner behavior is exercised via manual integration testing.

**Known Limitations:**
- Output scanning (LLM responses) is not systematically applied — model completions are not re-scanned before storage (see LLM02).
- Audit log entries include `detail_json` that could contain sensitive context if callers are not careful.
- No data classification framework (e.g., tagging fields as PII/PHI/PCI) is integrated into the data model.

## LLM07 – Insecure Plugin Design

**Description:** Plugin/tool interfaces that are overly permissive, lack input validation, do not enforce authentication, or allow SSRF, privilege escalation, or injection via tool parameters.

**RegentClaw Status:** Partially Shipped

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/services/ring_policy.py` (added in this release): Ring-based execution isolation classifies every action_type and exec channel into ring0..ring3, enforcing privilege tiers with deterministic approval gates. Prevents low-privilege agents from invoking privileged actions.
- `backend/app/api/routes/exec_channels.py`: Ring policy check applied before executing approved requests. ring0 actions are hard-blocked.
- `backend/app/services/connector_tester.py`: SSRF protection — connector test URLs are validated against a blocklist of private/reserved IP ranges before requests are made.
- Connector field validation (URL format, required fields) in connector creation routes.
- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/security_agent.py`: `TOOLS` list explicitly bounds what tools the security agent can invoke.

**Test Coverage:** `backend/tests/test_ring_policy.py` — 32 tests covering ring classification, evaluation, role escalation blocking, and channel mapping.

**Known Limitations:**
- Tool parameters passed to agents are not schema-validated against a strict allowlist — callers can supply arbitrary JSON.
- No runtime sandbox (seccomp, container isolation) prevents a plugin from making unexpected system calls.
- Plugin authentication is via the platform JWT — there is no per-plugin credential rotation or scoped token.
- The ring policy covers exec channels and remediation approvals, but not all tool invocation paths in ArcClaw's security agent.

## LLM08 – Excessive Agency

**Description:** LLM agents given more capabilities, permissions, or autonomy than needed to complete their task — leading to unauthorized actions, data destruction, or unintended side effects.

**RegentClaw Status:** Shipped (strengthened by ring policy in this release)

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/services/ring_policy.py`: Ring-based privilege isolation. Every action maps to ring0..ring3. ring0 is unconditionally blocked. ring1 (quarantine, suspend, revoke, delete_secret) requires 2 independent approvals. ring2 requires trust_score >= 80 or 1 approval. ring3 (read-only) is auto-allowed.
- `backend/app/api/routes/exec_channels.py` (`execute_request`): Ring policy evaluated before execution. Hard-blocked (ring0, low-role ring1) requests are refused with HTTP 403.
- `backend/app/api/routes/remediation.py` (`approve_action`): Ring policy check before calling `approve_remediation` — blocks role-escalation attempts.
- `backend/app/api/routes/exec_channels.py` (`approve_request`): Self-approval is blocked (`approver == r.requested_by` → 403). Dual approvals required for shell/browser/credential channels.
- Production gate system (`ProductionGate`) enforces dual approval for all production changes.
- Policy engine (`backend/app/services/policy_engine.py`): AGT/Swarm governance policies enforce swarm parallelism limits and approval gates on containment actions.
- `backend/app/services/exec_policy.py`: `evaluate_exec_request()` blocks commands matching destructive/credential-access patterns.

**Test Coverage:** `backend/tests/test_ring_policy.py` — 32 tests. No tests for the dual-approval or self-approval prevention paths.

**Known Limitations:**
- The ArcClaw security agent (`security_agent.py`) tool list is bounded but not dynamically validated against the ring policy at invocation time.
- Workflow runner (`workflow_runner.py`) can chain multiple actions — inter-step privilege accumulation is not yet tracked.
- No per-session capability token — an agent that obtains approval for one action could theoretically reuse context for adjacent actions.

---

## LLM09 – Overreliance

**Description:** Users or automated systems trusting LLM outputs without verification — leading to incorrect decisions, missed alerts, or automated actions based on hallucinated information.

**RegentClaw Status:** Partially Shipped

**Evidence:**

- `backend/app/claws/arcclaw/routes.py`: Every AI event is stored with a `risk_score` and `outcome` computed by the AGT audit + scanner. Users can see these scores in the dashboard.
- AI events are never auto-executed — they are written to the event log and surface as findings requiring human review or policy-matched auto-response.
- Remediation playbooks have `requires_approval` flag — high-risk playbooks require human sign-off before execution.
- Findings include `severity` and `confidence` fields to help operators contextualize AI-generated detections.

**Test Coverage:** No automated test.

**Known Limitations:**
- Risk scores are displayed to users but there is no enforcement mechanism preventing operators from always approving high-risk AI recommendations without review.
- No counter-factual or uncertainty quantification is presented alongside AI findings.
- The platform does not log when a human overrides or ignores an AI-generated alert — there is no "dismissed by user" audit trail.
- No calibration data or false-positive rate reporting is implemented.

---

## LLM10 – Model Theft

**Description:** Attackers extracting model weights, system prompts, or training data through API abuse, timing attacks, or adversarial probing.

**RegentClaw Status:** N/A / Partial

**Evidence:**

- RegentClaw does not host model weights. All inference is via provider APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama). Model theft from the RegentClaw platform itself is not applicable.
- `backend/app/services/secrets_manager.py`: Provider API keys encrypted at rest with Fernet. Keys are never logged or returned via API.
- System prompts used by ArcClaw's security agent (`backend/app/claws/arcclaw/security_agent.py`) are stored in source code — not separately protected.
- No system prompt confidentiality enforcement (prompt extraction via token probabilities or completion nudging is not mitigated).

**Test Coverage:** N/A

**Known Limitations:**
- System prompts are visible in source code — if source is leaked, prompt intellectual property is exposed.
- No mechanism to detect adversarial probing attempts (repeated queries designed to reconstruct system prompt).
- Provider-side model theft is entirely dependent on the provider's security posture.
