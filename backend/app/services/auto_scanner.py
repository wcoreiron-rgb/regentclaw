"""
RegentClaw — Auto Scanner
Triggers claw scans automatically when connectors are configured or approved.

Flow:
  1. Connector credentials are saved → trigger_scans_for_connector() called
  2. For each claw that uses that connector type → call the claw's /scan endpoint
  3. Runs as a FastAPI BackgroundTask (non-blocking)

Also used by the background scheduler for periodic scanning.
