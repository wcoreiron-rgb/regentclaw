"""
Multi-tenant isolation tests for RegentClaw.

These tests verify — honestly — whether each resource boundary is enforced.
Where enforcement is absent, tests are marked xfail with a documented reason
so CI surfaces the gap rather than hiding it behind a green suite.

Tenant model: ownership is expressed via owner_id (Connector) or actor/
requested_by string fields (AuditLog, SwarmJob). There is no platform-wide
tenant_id column; isolation is currently ad-hoc per model.
